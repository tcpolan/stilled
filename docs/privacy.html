  <h1>Privacy Policy for Stilled</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: February 8, 2026</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Stilled ("the App") is a video-to-photo extraction tool developed by Thomas Polan. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Stilled does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No analytics or tracking:</strong> The App does not use any analytics frameworks, crash reporters, or tracking tools.</li>
    <li><strong>No network requests:</strong> The App operates entirely on your device. It does not connect to any servers or third-party services.</li>
    <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> The App does not require you to create an account or sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>No advertising:</strong> The App contains no ads and does not use any advertising SDKs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App requests the following permissions, which are used solely for the described purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> Required to browse your videos and save extracted still images to your camera roll. Your photos and videos are never uploaded, transmitted, or shared.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All processing happens locally on your device. The App does not store any data beyond what the iOS operating system manages (such as cached thumbnails during a session, which are temporary).</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Stilled does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect user data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected here with an updated date.</p>
