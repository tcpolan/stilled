**Last updated: February 8, 2026**

## Overview

Stilled ("the App") is a video-to-photo extraction tool developed by Thomas Polan. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection

Stilled does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:

- **No analytics or tracking:** The App does not use any analytics frameworks, crash reporters, or tracking tools.
- **No network requests:** The App operates entirely on your device. It does not connect to any servers or third-party services.
- **No accounts:** The App does not require you to create an account or sign in.
- **No advertising:** The App contains no ads and does not use any advertising SDKs.

## Device Permissions

The App requests the following permissions, which are used solely for the described purposes:

- **Photo Library Access:** Required to browse your videos and save extracted still images to your camera roll. Your photos and videos are never uploaded, transmitted, or shared.

## Data Storage

All processing happens locally on your device. The App does not store any data beyond what the iOS operating system manages (such as cached thumbnails during a session, which are temporary).

## Third-Party Services

Stilled does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect user data.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
